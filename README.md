# NodeJS Masterclass

## Course Description

In this course, I gained a comprehensive understanding of Node.js, including its core modules, NPM, and the underlying mechanisms such as the event loop and non-blocking code. The curriculum delved into Express for routing and middleware, as well as the creation of RESTful APIs featuring advanced filtering, sorting, and pagination capabilities. I learned about server-side rendering with Pug templates and performed CRUD operations with MongoDB, both locally and on the Atlas platform. The course also covered advanced MongoDB topics, including geospatial queries, the aggregation pipeline, and using Mongoose for data modeling and validation. Key components of the course included:

- The MVC architecture
- Advanced data modeling in NoSQL databases
- Modern authentication with JWT
- User authorization

Additionally, the course emphasized security best practices, such as encryption and sanitization. I learned how to integrate Stripe for credit card payments, manage file uploads, process images, and send emails using Mailtrap and Sendgrid. Finally, the course covered advanced error handling and deploying applications to Heroku.



## Section 2: Introduction to Node.js and NPM

I started with an introduction to Node.js, learning about its core modules and how to use NPM. I set up a Node.js project, managed dependencies, created template HTML files, and connected JSON data on the backend to populate these templates. Additionally, I created my own module and utilized various built-in and external modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`, `url`, `replaceTemplate`, and `slugify`. I also learned how to read files, write to them, and append text to other files.
