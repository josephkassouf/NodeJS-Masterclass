# NodeJS Masterclass

## Course Description

In this course, I learn the fundamentals of Node.js, including core modules and NPM, and how Node.js works behind the scenes with concepts like the event loop and non-blocking code. I dive into Express for routing and middleware, and develop RESTful APIs with advanced features such as filtering, sorting, and pagination. I explore server-side rendering with Pug templates, and perform CRUD operations with MongoDB both locally and on the Atlas platform. I cover advanced MongoDB topics like geospatial queries and the aggregation pipeline, along with Mongoose for data modeling and validation. The course includes the MVC architecture, advanced data modeling in NoSQL databases, modern authentication with JWT, and user authorization. I emphasize security best practices, including encryption and sanitization, and learn to accept credit card payments with Stripe, upload files, process images, and send emails with Mailtrap and Sendgrid. Finally, I master advanced error handling, deploy applications to Heroku, and get a crash course on Git and GitHub.


## Section 2: Introduction to Node.js and NPM

I started with an introduction to Node.js, learning about its core modules and how to use NPM. I set up a Node.js project, managed dependencies, created template HTML files, and connected JSON data on the backend to populate these templates. Additionally, I created my own module and utilized various built-in and external modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`, `url`, `replaceTemplate`, and `slugify`. I also learned how to read files, write to them, and append text to other files.
